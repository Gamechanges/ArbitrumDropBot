@ArbitrumDropBot is an open-source Telegram bot that allows for easy tracking and management of Arbitrum airdrops.

1. Check Wallets
After clicking the [Check Wallets] button, you need to submit a list of wallets you want to check. Each wallet should be on a new line.
Example: ---------------------------------
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111
0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222
..........................................
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
------------------------------------------
After submitting the list, the bot will provide you with the following results for each wallet:
- The number of ARB tokens that can be claimed for each individual wallet.
- The total balance of the airdrop across all wallets.

2. Countdown
After clicking the [Countdown] button, the bot will display the current block number and how many blocks are left until the claim starts.
