@ArbitrumDropBot is an open-source Telegram bot that allows for easy tracking and management of Arbitrum airdrops.

Check Wallets
After clicking the [Check Wallets] button, you need to submit a list of wallets you want to check. Each wallet should be on a new line.<br>
**Example:**<br>
``0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000``<br>
``0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111``<br>
``0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222``<br>
``..........................................``<br>
``0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF``<br>
<br>
After submitting the list, the bot will provide you with the following results for each wallet:
-  The number of ARB tokens that can be claimed for each individual wallet.
-  The total balance of the airdrop across all wallets.
<br>
Countdown
After clicking the [Countdown] button, the bot will display the current block number and how many blocks are left until the claim starts.
